# CSE-519-Human-Computer-Interaction
I have opted for CSE 519 Human Computer Interaction Course. In This repo I will share the design of An app related to fitness and health management. The design will be made using Figma, Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, and from the principles of IBM Design System and Class. 

Fitness Application UI / UX
Name of The App: ShapeShift

Main features: 
1) Food Sharing Community Service UI / UX
Importance: Here the food is shared by the people of the community and checked by the Trainers and Nutrionist and then placed in the proper category. There are four categories of Protein, Carbohydrates, Fats, Vitamins, and special category of Vegetarians.


2) Virtual Training Service:
It is an integral part of a fitness application. Different aspects of activities like cycling, yoga, cardio are included in this. The user has to tap on “Book Now” option and then some meeting link, for instance, Zoom or Google Meet will be sent to the registered email id and then the user can attend the meeting from there

3) Barcode Scanner For Food Information:
Barcode scanner for getting information about the food, like how much proteins, fats, carbohydrates and cholesterol it contains. They have been divided into positive and negative effects on the basis of health disadvantages.

4) Exercise Playlist:
The aim of this feature is to enable the user to listen to music while they workout. This feature provides the user with the ability to select a music streaming platform of their choice and integrate their playlists within the application. The user can then choose songs from the playlist as per their choice.
